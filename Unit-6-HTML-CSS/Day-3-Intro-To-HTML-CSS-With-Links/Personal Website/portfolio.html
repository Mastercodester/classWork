                <h2>Muddies </h2>
                <p>I launched and operated Muddies Soulfood, a food truck business that allowed me to apply my business management skills in real-time.</p>
                <p> I handled everything from business planning, menu creation, vendor relationships, and daily operations to customer service, marketing, and financial management.</p>
                <p> Through this venture, I gained valuable experience in small business ownership, team leadership, and adapting to the fast-paced food industry, all of which I now use to help other entrepreneurs grow and succeed.</p>

                    <h2>Tech Projects </h2>
                    <p>As part of my tech consulting work, I’ve led and contributed to several software development projects. </p>
                    <p>A key project was my Farm to Table App (FACTS App), which connects local farmers to consumers, promoting access to fresh produce and supporting local economies.</p>
                    <p> I also developed a Library Management System during my training, which allowed users to check book availability and track inventory. </p>
                    <p>Through these projects, I gained deep experience in app design, development processes, user interface planning, and project management, giving me the tools to help clients build, refine, and launch their own tech products. </p>

                    <h2>Music  </h2>
                    <p>Under my artist name Smokkey P, I’ve created, engineered, and released original music, gaining hands-on experience with the full music production and release cycle.</p>
                    <p> I manage my own recording sessions, mixing, mastering, and collaborate with video teams to shoot professional visuals for my songs.</p>
                    <p> I’ve successfully distributed my music across major streaming platforms while building marketing strategies to grow my audience.  </p>
                    <p> This real-world experience allows me to guide other artists through recording, production, visual content creation, digital distribution, and brand development.</p>
